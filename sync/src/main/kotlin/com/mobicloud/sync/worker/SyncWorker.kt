/**
 * WorkManager worker that synchronizes local data with Firebase Firestore in the background.
 *
 * This worker handles bidirectional data synchronization between the local Room database
 * and remote Firestore. It runs as a foreground service with a notification, showing
 * sync progress to the user.
 *
 * ## Sync Process
 * 1. **Pull Phase**: Download changes from Firestore since last sync
 * 2. **Push Phase**: Upload local changes (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) to Firestore
 * 3. **Progress Updates**: Update foreground notification with current progress
 * 4. **Result**: Mark sync as complete or retry on failure
 *
 * ## Foreground Service
 * The worker runs as an expedited foreground service to:
 * - Show sync progress in a notification
 * - Prevent the system from killing the process during sync
 * - Comply with Android 12+ background execution limits
 *
 * ## Retry Logic
 * - Automatic retry up to [TOTAL_SYNC_ATTEMPTS] (3) times
 * - Exponential backoff between retries (handled by WorkManager)
 * - Logs retry attempts for debugging
 * - Returns `Result.failure()` after exhausting all retries
 *
 * ## Dependency Injection
 * This class uses Hilt's `@AssistedInject` to inject dependencies into the Worker.
 * WorkManager parameters (`Context`, `WorkerParameters`) are provided by the `@Assisted`
 * annotation, while app dependencies are injected normally.
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 * All work is executed on the [ioDispatcher] to ensure proper threading and avoid
 * blocking the main thread. The repository's sync method returns a Flow that emits
 * progress updates.
 *
 * @param context The application context provided by WorkManager
 * @param workerParameters Worker parameters provided by WorkManager
 * @param ioDispatcher The IO coroutine dispatcher for performing sync operations
 * @param homeRepository The repository that performs the actual sync logic
 *
 * @see Sync
 * @see SyncManager
 * @see com.mobicloud.data.repository.home.HomeRepository.sync

     *
     * This method:
     * 1. Promotes the worker to a foreground service with a progress notification
     * 2. Calls the repository's sync method which returns a Flow of progress updates
     * 3. Updates the notification as sync progresses
     * 4. Returns success/retry/failure based on the outcome
     *
     * ## Sync Flow
     * ```kotlin
     * homeRepository.sync() // Returns Flow<SyncProgress>
     *     .collect { progress ->

     *         setForeground(getForegroundInfo(progress.total, progress.current))
     *     }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Error Handling
     * - **Retry**: If [runAttemptCount] < [TOTAL_SYNC_ATTEMPTS], returns `Result.retry()`
     * - **Failure**: After exhausting retries, returns `Result.failure()`
     * - **Success**: Returns `Result.success()` when sync completes without errors
     *
     * ## Threading
     * All operations run on [ioDispatcher] to avoid blocking the main thread.
     *
     * @return [Result.success] if sync completed successfully,
     *         [Result.retry] if sync failed but retries remain,
     *         [Result.failure] if sync failed after all retries
