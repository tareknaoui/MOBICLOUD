 * Interface representing a syncable entity.

 * ## Implementation Pattern
 * ```kotlin
 * override suspend fun sync(): Flow<SyncProgress> = flow {
 *     emit(SyncProgress(total = 100, current = 0, message = "Starting sync"))
 *     // Fetch from network
 *     val data = networkDataSource.getData()
 *     // Update local database
 *     localDataSource.saveData(data)
 *     emit(SyncProgress(total = 100, current = 100, message = "Sync complete"))
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @sample com.mobicloud.data.repository.home.HomeRepositoryImpl.sync Complete sync implementation with push/pull
 *
 * @see SyncProgress For progress reporting
 * @see SyncManager For triggering sync operations
