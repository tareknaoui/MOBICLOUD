/**
 * Interface defining data source operations for Firebase Authentication.
 *
 * This interface provides a unified abstraction over Firebase Authentication and Android's
 * Credential Manager API. It supports multiple authentication methods including email/password
 * and Google Sign-In, with built-in credential saving for seamless re-authentication.
 *
 * ## Authentication Flow
 * 1. **First Time Users**: Call [registerWithEmailAndPassword] or [registerWithGoogle]
 * 2. **Returning Users**: Call [signInWithSavedCredentials] or specific sign-in methods
 * 3. **Session Check**: Use [getCurrentUser] to check authentication state
 * 4. **Sign Out**: Call [signOut] to clear authentication state
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 * All suspend functions should be called from a coroutine context with appropriate dispatcher.
 * The implementation ensures thread safety by using Firebase's built-in thread handling.
 *
 * ## Error Handling
 * All authentication methods can throw exceptions:
 * - `FirebaseAuthInvalidCredentialsException` - Wrong email/password
 * - `FirebaseAuthUserCollisionException` - Email already in use
 * - `FirebaseAuthInvalidUserException` - User account doesn't exist
 * - `FirebaseNetworkException` - Network connectivity issues
 * - `CancellationException` - User cancelled the authentication flow
 *
 * Wrap calls in `suspendRunCatching` for proper error handling.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ```kotlin
 * class AuthRepository @Inject constructor(
 *     private val authDataSource: AuthDataSource
 * ) {
 *     // Check current auth state
 *     fun isSignedIn(): Boolean = authDataSource.getCurrentUser() != null
 *
 *     // Sign in with saved credentials (auto-login)
 *     suspend fun autoSignIn(activity: Activity): Result<AuthUser> =
 *         suspendRunCatching {
 *             authDataSource.signInWithSavedCredentials(activity)
 *         }
 *
 *     // Email/password sign in
 *     suspend fun signIn(email: String, password: String): Result<AuthUser> =
 *         suspendRunCatching {
 *             authDataSource.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
 *         }
 *
 *     // Google Sign-In
 *     suspend fun signInWithGoogle(activity: Activity): Result<AuthUser> =
 *         suspendRunCatching {
 *             authDataSource.signInWithGoogle(activity)
 *         }
 *
 *     // Sign out
 *     suspend fun signOut(): Result<Unit> =
 *         suspendRunCatching {
 *             authDataSource.signOut()
 *         }
 * }
 * ```
 *

 * @see FirebaseAuth

     *
     * This is a synchronous operation that returns immediately with the cached authentication
     * state from Firebase. It does not perform any network operations.
     *
     * ## Use Cases
     * - Check if user is signed in before showing authenticated content
     * - Get user ID for database queries
     * - Display user profile information
     * - Initialize app state based on auth status
     *
     * ## Example
     * ```kotlin
     * val currentUser = authDataSource.getCurrentUser()
     * if (currentUser != null) {
     *     // User is signed in, show authenticated content
     *     loadUserData(currentUser.id)
     * } else {
     *     // User is signed out, show login screen
     *     navigateToLogin()

    /**
     * Attempts to sign in using credentials saved in Android's Credential Manager.

     * This method leverages Android's Credential Manager API to retrieve saved credentials
     * (email/password or Google account) and authenticate the user automatically. This enables
     * seamless "one-tap" sign-in without requiring the user to re-enter credentials.
     *
     * ## Behavior
     * - Shows the Credential Manager UI with saved credentials
     * - User selects a saved credential to sign in
     * - Authenticates with Firebase using the selected credential
     * - Saves/updates the credential in Credential Manager after successful sign-in
     *
     * ## Requirements
     * - Requires an Activity context for showing the credential picker UI
     * - Credentials must have been previously saved via Credential Manager
     * - User must have at least one saved credential
     *
     * ## Exceptions
     * - Throws `CancellationException` if user cancels the credential picker
     * - Throws `NoCredentialException` if no saved credentials are found
     * - Throws `FirebaseAuthException` if authentication with saved credentials fails
     *
     * ## Example
     * ```kotlin
     * // In your login ViewModel
     * fun autoSignIn() {
     *     _uiState.updateStateWith {
     *         authRepository.signInWithSavedCredentials(activity)
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * @param activity The activity instance required for showing the credential picker UI
     * @return The authenticated [AuthUser] upon successful sign-in
     * @throws CancellationException if the user cancels the operation
     * @throws Exception for authentication failures

     * authentication state. Note that this does NOT clear saved credentials from Android's
     * Credential Manager - the user can still use one-tap sign-in after signing out.

     * ## Behavior
     * - Clears Firebase Authentication session
     * - Clears any cached user data
     * - After sign-out, [getCurrentUser] will return null
     * - Saved credentials in Credential Manager remain available
     *
     * ## Use Cases
     * - User-initiated sign out
     * - Switching accounts
     * - Security-related sign out (e.g., suspicious activity)
     *
     * ## Thread Safety
     * This is a suspend function that performs async operations. Call from a coroutine context.
     *
     * ## Example
     * ```kotlin
     * // In your settings ViewModel
     * fun signOut() {
     *     _uiState.updateWith {
     *         authRepository.signOut()
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Note on Credential Manager
     * If you want to also clear saved credentials from Credential Manager, you need to
     * call the Credential Manager API separately:
     * ```kotlin
     * suspend fun signOutAndClearCredentials(context: Context) {
     *     authDataSource.signOut()
     *     // Additional code to clear Credential Manager credentials if needed
     * }
     * ```
     */
    suspend fun signOut()
}
