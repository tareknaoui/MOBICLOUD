/**
 * Implementation of [CrashReporter] that uses Firebase Crashlytics.
 *
 * This implementation reports non-fatal exceptions to Firebase Crashlytics, allowing you to
 * track errors that don't cause crashes but indicate potential issues in your app. Reports
 * are batched and uploaded in the background, with minimal impact on app performance.
 *
 * ## Setup Requirements
 * 1. Add `google-services.json` to the app module
 * 2. Ensure Firebase Crashlytics is initialized in Application.onCreate()
 * 3. Configure ProGuard/R8 mapping file upload for release builds
 *
 * ## Data Collection
 * Each crash report includes:
 * - Full stack trace
 * - Device information (model, OS version, screen size, etc.)
 * - App version and build number
 * - Custom keys and logs (if set via FirebaseCrashlytics API)
 * - User identifier (if set via FirebaseCrashlytics.setUserId())
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 * This implementation is thread-safe and can be called from any thread.
 *
 * @property crashlytics The Firebase Crashlytics instance, injected via Hilt
 * @see CrashReporter

     * @param throwable The exception to be reported. The full stack trace and exception
     *                  message will be included in the Crashlytics report.
